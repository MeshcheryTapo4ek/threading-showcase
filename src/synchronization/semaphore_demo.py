"""
semaphore_demo.py â€” Demonstrates limiting concurrent access using threading.Semaphore.

This example simulates multiple clients trying to use a limited resource (e.g., database),
but only a fixed number of them can access it at the same time.

Useful when you want to limit parallelism: connections, GPU access, etc.
