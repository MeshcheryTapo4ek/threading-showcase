"""
barrier_demo.py â€” Full showcase of threading.Barrier features.

This demo illustrates:
- threads arriving at the barrier at different times (via random delays),
- use of .n_waiting and .broken to monitor the barrier state,
- one thread exceeding the timeout and breaking the barrier,
- proper handling of BrokenBarrierError in other threads,
- coordinator thread detecting and resetting the broken barrier.
