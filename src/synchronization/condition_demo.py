"""
condition_demo.py â€” Demonstrates signaling between threads using threading.Condition.

This version includes:
- randomized producer and consumer delays,
- detailed commentary on behavior and race conditions,
- classic producer-consumer buffer logic using Condition.

Key idea: Consumers wait when the buffer is empty,
Producers wait when the buffer is full,
and both coordinate using `condition.wait()` / `condition.notify()`.
