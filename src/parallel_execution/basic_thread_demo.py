"""
basic_thread_demo.py â€” Shows how to start multiple threads manually using threading.Thread.

This is the rawest way to create threads:
- Define a function
- Start N threads manually
- Wait for them to finish using .join()

This approach is simple but doesn't scale well â€” you'll see why soon.
