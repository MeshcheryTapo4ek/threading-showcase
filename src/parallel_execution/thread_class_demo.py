"""
thread_class_demo.py â€” Demonstrates subclassing threading.Thread.

Each worker is an instance of a custom Thread subclass that:
- holds its own inputs and output,
- logs its execution flow,
- exposes a `.result` after joining.

This pattern is useful when you need full control over thread logic/state.
