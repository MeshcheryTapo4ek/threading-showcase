"""
futures_with_results.py â€” Demonstrates using submit() and result() to retrieve outputs from threads.

This approach gives:
- fine-grained control over task submission,
- access to Future objects (can be cancelled, checked, etc),
- ability to process results in submission order (not completion order).
